### What is a tree in Python? 

Trees are non-linear data structures that represent nodes connected by edges. Each tree consists of a root node as the Parent node, and the left node and right node as Child nodes.

### What are trees used for in Python?

A Binary Tree is a non-linear data structure that is used for searching and data organization. A binary tree is comprised of nodes. Each node being a data component, one a left child and the other the right child. Let us dive into the concepts related to trees and implement them into the Python programming language.

### How do you make a tree in Python?

To insert into a tree we use the same node class created above and add a insert class to it. The insert class compares the value of the node to the parent node and decides to add it as a left node or a right node. Finally the PrintTree class is used to print the tree.
